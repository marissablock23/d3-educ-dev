# Education as a Binding Constraint




## Setup

As always, have npm/node/yarn installed.

```sh
npm install
# then
npm run start
```


You will still need to be explicit about your imports, eg
```js
import {functionFromModule} from 'target-module';
```

In this scaffold I have not installed any d3 packages. Some helpful ones (read the ones I usually end up using) are d3-selection, d3-scale, and d3-shape. To add one of these packages just do

```sh
npm install --save PACKAGENAME
